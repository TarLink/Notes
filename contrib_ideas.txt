  - REST API framework, based on Mongoose (doing what the OTaC API does)
  - Angular translate toolkit:
     - Extraction:
        - to json, js, cson or po
        - merging to previous output
        - comments, and other po/gettext nice things
     - JsonToPo, Po2json
     - Po utilities
  - Video analytics (unless already done):
     - record all HTML5 video events
     - nice data visualization
  - Better session recorder:
     - better alternative to session replays tools like inspectlet, mouseflow, sessioncam
     - they work by recording few UI events, then replaying them on a still server-side-generated webpage screenshot
     - different approach:
        - record HTML+CSS:
           - how:
              - either poll for snapshots
              - or listen to MutationObserver DOM events, and record increment in a smart way
           - problems:
              - need to simulate browser (SauceLabs, etc.) to get real picture
              - what about links? they need to be fetched right away
           - benefit: work with single-page-applications, i.e. JavaScript that changes HTML+CSS
           - other approach: take client-side screenshot if possible?
        - record all DOM events, not only click and scroll
        - record XHR?
        - need to figure out how to replay embedded elements, i.e. <audio>, <video>, <canvas>
        - record user ID/profile (need to check legality of this)
           - can also integrate with CRM
        - not recording sensitive information
        - events on native apps
        - events on IoT
        - forwards to own storage
     - like the other approaches:
        - record page change (including HTML5 history)
        - record general analytics (e.g. user agent) to be able to filter recording/visualization
        - computation/visualization:
           - heatmaps, for each DOM event and their computation, with overlay on site
           - overlay on site with max scrolling
           - form controls interaction
           - funnels
           - computed events (e.g. pageview->click), with overlay on site
           - comments on recording
           - search bar
        - export to video
        - REST API
        - integrations to push content to analytics, A/B testing tools, voice of customer
        - integrations to put snippet to CMS, etc.
        - whitelist pages to record
        - performance: only record a sample of visits, realtime, requests queueing/batch, rate customization, 
        - adminitration: many sites, permissions
     - business approach:
        - open-source code
        - storing and generating replays: SaaS
