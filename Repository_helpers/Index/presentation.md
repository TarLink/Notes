# Structure #

The directory structure reflects how I [design](Theory) systems:
  - I do not believe in a single language or framework which can solve any problem. Tools come and go. That's why they are at the lowest level in the directory structure (before the file extension).
  - What matters is to pick the best architecture to fulfill a set of [functional requirements](Functional_requirements)
  - In order to so, [non-functional requirements](Non_functional_requirements) must be considered, usually resulting in trade-offs (e.g. _featureful_ vs. _simple_, _stable_ vs. _cutting-edge_, or _optimized_ vs. _easy to maintain_)
  - This results in choosing a specific [architecture](Architecture): platform, languages, IPC, etc.
