License:
  - figure out what are my goals
  - find best license combinations

Market research:
  - competitors:
     - features
        - including how capture is done
     - license
     - pricing
     - volume (e.g. number of users, website traffic)
     - marketing communication/strategy
     - clients (industries)
     - team size and roles

Ideas:
  - only show interaction on specific page or element or screen region
  - heatmaps on specific element, wherever it was in the screen region
  - UX research tools features?
     - could be browser extension
     - but then shouldn't it use webrtc screen capture?

Goal:
  - to capture user experience
  - possible uses:
     - debugging
     - sales
     - UX research

Features:
  - to capture user experience:
     - replay fidelity
        - including touch UX
     - enriched UX:
        - flagged events
        - form control interaction
     - data visualization
        - replay
        - heatmap
        - form analytics
        - crosstabulation with agent/session properties
  - without deteriorating it:
     - client performance
     - privacy
     - security
  - programmer-friendly:
     - open source
     - programmer-friendly (e.g. REST API)
     - integrations

DOM element variation:
  - always unique vs often same
  - big vs small region
  - big change (whole children different) vs small change (add one specific child)
  - same DOM element but in a different place, or wrapped

Same DOM element but different CSS because:
  - slightly different attributes
  - different children
  - variation of another DOM element changing this element's:
     - intrisic CSS
     - place in the flow
  - different matching CSS media query

Same DOM element but different signature although CSS same

Idea (heatmaps):
  - use filters:
     - on the state:
        - DOM element: present, HTML/CSS properties
        - user agent (width|height, etc.)
        - URL
        - etc.
     - which updates:
        - DOM: show most common snapshot
           - definition of "common": most individual DOM elements (according to signature) shared by other snapshots
        - events used for heatmap
  - event targeting:
     - on DOM element, wherever it is on the page
     - use percentage positioning, inside the DOM element box
     - need good signature: even if different children, or slightly different parent (wrapping), or slightly different HTML attributes

Idea (session replay):
  - polls to log state (including all DOM)
     - optimization: use recursive hash to not send same part of DOM twice
  - log events, with their target signature and position inside target

Idea (form analytics):
  - can be retrieved from events
