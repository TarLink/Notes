MODULARITY ==>                    #Dividing into different modules, aiming at orthogonality/separation of concern:

                                  #Modules can be excluded from the sequence, according to input properties (e.g. its type)

MEDIATOR ==>                      #Abstracting away relations between items when they are too complex, e.g.:

EVENTS/HOOKS ==>                  #Decoupling:

                                  #  - observer: notify subjects about an event (so callbacks are fired), optionally with parameters
                                  #Alternative to waiting for return value, or providing callback as argument:
                                  #  - more abstract, less coupled

                                  #     - can abstract functional control (debounce, delay, once, etc.) into the event handling system
                                  #  - more flexible than callbacks, i.e. dynamic (add|remove) 
                                  #Can filter incoming events according to:
                                  #  - "topic-based": event name
                                  #  - "content-based": event parameters

                                  #  - can also hold weak references instead, allowing garbage collection

PUBLISH / SUBSCRIBE ==>           #Also called "Pub/Sub"

                                  #  - might perform extra functions, e.g.: content|format transformation, aggregation|decomposition, logging, queuing, etc.
                                  #  - even more abstract and less coupled, but less flexible
