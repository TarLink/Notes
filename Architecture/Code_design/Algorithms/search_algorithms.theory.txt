PRUNING ==>                       #During a search algorithm, skipping a node's descendants when they
                                  #can be guessed (from the parent's value) to be invalid.
                                  #Unless pruning can be done, search algorithms like BFS/DFS are conceptually a linear search.

BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS) ==>    #Search one level at a time, i.e.:

                                  #        - without proper balancing:
                                  #           - height will average √order, and complexity O(√n)
                                  #           - can even be O(n) if search tree degenerated into a line graph

                                  #     - like search

                                  #  - no lower limit of outdegree for root
                                  #  - node's value is an array or numbers:
                                  #     - acting as separators between each two children
                                  #  - U can be picked to try to make nodes the same size as an I/O block
                                  #Similar to binary search tree:
                                  #  - which can be considered a b-tree of order 2
                                  #The higher the order:
                                  #  - better when nodes are read|write sequentially
                                  #     - i.e. when siblings nodes are usually read|write together
                                  #     - e.g. a file's blocks
                                  #  - instead of O(log₂ n), performs in O(m*logₘ n) to find node
                                  #    (which is worst), but then iterating|inserting|deleting siblings is faster
                                  #  - worst time complexity: some space is empty
                                  #  - less frequent balancing needed
                                  #If U is very high, can:
                                  #  - implement keys as a search tree themselves instead of a simple array
                                  #  - use delta encoding compression on keys (better space, worst time)

                                  #        - must change parent keys as well

                                  #  - can be done either:
                                  #     - between operations
                                  #     - during operation, as nodes are being visited

B+ TREE ==>                       #B-tree where:
                                  #  - values are stored only on leaves
                                  #  - each leaf contains a pointer to next leaf (i.e. linked list)
                                  #I.e. like B-tree but with better sequential access accross several leaves.

HEAP ==>                          #Tree satisfying the "heap property":
                                  #  - "max heap": parent node's key >= child's key
                                  #  - "min heap": parent node's key <= child's key
                                  #Useful to search min|max value, e.g. to implement a priority queue.
                                  #Operations:
                                  #  - peek_max|min(): O(1)
                                  #  - pull_max|min(): O(log n)
                                  #  - insert(NODE): O(log n)
                                  #  - delete(): arbitrary node
                                  #  - set_key(NODE, KEY): O(log n)
                                  #  - merge(HEAP, HEAP2)->HEAP3: O(n)
                                  #  - size()->NUM
                                  #Complexity depends on implementation (those are the most common).

RANDOM SEARCH TREE ==>            #When shuffling nodes before inserting many of them in a search tree.
                                  #Reason:
                                  #  - lower depth in average
                                  #  - e.g. inserting many sorted nodes (without balancing) would otherwise
                                  #    create a graph list as a subtree, increasing depth linearly
                                  #Variants:
                                  #  - do a random pick among all possible trees after insertion of each
                                  #    permutation of the nodes.
                                  #For a binary search tree, in average, depth will be:
                                  #  - mean: 2*log(n)+1
                                  #  - max: 4.3*log(n)

RANGE QUERY ==>                   #Performing an operation over a subset of an array
                                  #Operation can be:
                                  #  - minimum|maximum ("range minimum|maximum query" (RMQ))
                                  #  - mode ("range mode query")
                                  #  - median

CARTESIAN TREE ==>                #Heap built from a sequence of keys, that can be reversed to that sequence of keys with
                                  #an in-order traversal.

                                  #  - from "all nearest smaller values" algorithm:
                                  #     - going in both directions, i.e. building left|right neighbors
                                  #     - if has no left|right neighbors, is root
                                  #     - if higher neighbor is left|right, put as right|left child of it
                                  #Goal is efficient range minimum query:
                                  #  - minimum of any subset of the original sequence of keys
                                  #    is the lowest common ancestor to the first and last keys of the subset
                                  #  - time complexity: O(1)
                                  #  - space complexity: O(n) (storing the tree itself)

ALL NEAREST SMALLER VALUES ==>    #Algorithm:
                                  #  - in a sequence of values
                                  #  - for each value:
