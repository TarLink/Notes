MEMORY AND SWAP ACCOUTING ==>     #  - must be enabled on the OS: performance impact, but better OS memory management

                                  #     - limit number of layers

IMAGE/CONTAINERS ==>              #Are basically a tree of files, with metadata (e.g. COMMANDs)
                                  #Image/containers are basically the same except:
                                  #  - order: container is last layer, images all others
                                  #  - write operations:
                                  #     - when writing to a file, use first layer (starting with container) where this file exists
                                  #     - container is read-write, i.e. normal operation
                                  #     - images are read-only, copy-on-write: copy the file (applying modification to it) to topmost layer (i.e. container)
                                  #  - git commit transform container into image

BUILD LAYERS ==>                  #Works in layers:
                                  #  - each layer only contains modification from parent image
                                  #  - parent images are read-only, shared by reference
                                  #     - uses "storage drivers" (see above)
                                  #  - layers are images or containers
                                  #Each Dockerfile instruction (docker build) or commit (docker commit) creates a new layer:
                                  #  - intermediate IMAGE are removed at the end
                                  #  - each layer creates a new shell, e.g. $PWD will be reset 
                                  #     - should limit number of layers, i.e. combine instructions as much as possible
                                  #  - max 127 layers

BUILD CONTEXT ==>                 #Directories:
                                  #  - BUILD_DIR: specified by docker build
                                  #  - CONTEXT_DIR: temporary, copied from BUILD_DIR
                                  #  - IMAGE_DIR: when image is created
                                  #CONTEXT_DIR:
                                  #  - sent by client to server:
                                  #     - should keep it minimal
                                  #  - can be used by Dockerfile instructions: COPY|ADD, COMMANDs
                                  #     - path resolution:
                                  #        - absolute path: relative to CONTEXT_DIR
                                  #        - relative path: 
                                  #           - relative to current dir, which is initially CONTEXT_DIR
                                  #           - can be changed by WORKDIR (see below)
                                  #  - copied from BUILD_DIR:
                                  #     - minus files matching BUILD_DIR/.dockerignore:
                                  #        - recommended
                                  #        - newline-separated, similar to .gitignore
                                  #        - # COMMENT, first line only
                                  #        - globbing: * ? ** !

BUILD CACHE ==>                   #Each layer + next instruction is cached:
                                  #  - by def reused if matched
                                  #  - specified in output log "Using cache"
                                  #Invalidates cache:
                                  #  - ADD|COPY of new|newer files
                                  #     - i.e. should be as late as possible, in order to invalidate fewer cache
                                  #  - ARG with different value
                                  #Does not invalidate cache:
                                  #  - COMMANDs, even if takes input from some global/changing state (e.g. apt-get update)
                                  #  - this can create problem, but can be disabled with docker build --no-cache

PERMISSIONS ==>                   #Default user is dockerd's, but can change with USER
                                  #Containers are always unprivileged:
                                  #  - can do apt-get install -y
                                  #  - but apt-get upgrade will fail on some core packages
                                  #  - apt-get update:
                                  #     - on its own, creates cache problems (avoid)
                                  #     - creates non-predictability unless pinning version, e.g. apt-get install -y PACKAGE=VERSION

AUFS ==>                          #Only with backing filesystem ext4, XFS or ZFS

                                  #     - bad if lots of write, because slow CoW
