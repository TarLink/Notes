Same DOM element but different CSS because:
  - slightly different attributes
  - different matching CSS media query
  - different children

DOM element variation changes CSS of other elements:
  - intrisic CSS
  - place in the flow

DOM element variation:
  - always vs sometimes
  - big vs small region
  - big change (whole children different) vs small change (add one specific child)
