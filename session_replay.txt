DOM element variation:
  - always unique vs often same
  - big vs small region
  - big change (whole children different) vs small change (add one specific child)
  - same DOM element but in a different place, or wrapped

Same DOM element but different CSS because:
  - slightly different attributes
  - different children
  - variation of another DOM element changing this element's:
     - intrisic CSS
     - place in the flow
  - different matching CSS media query

Same DOM element but different signature although CSS same


Idea (heatmaps):
  - use filters:
     - on the state:
        - DOM element: present, HTML/CSS properties
        - user agent (width|height, etc.)
        - URL
        - etc.
     - which updates:
        - DOM: show most common snapshot
           - definition of "common": most individual DOM elements (according to signature) shared by other snapshots
        - events used for heatmap
  - event targeting:
     - on DOM element, wherever it is on the page
     - use percentage positioning, inside the DOM element box
     - need good signature: even if different children, or slightly different parent (wrapping), or slightly different HTML attributes

Idea (session replay):
  - polls to log state (including all DOM)
     - optimization: use recursive hash to not send same part of DOM twice
  - log events, with their target signature and position inside target

Idea (form analytics):
  - can be retrieved from events
