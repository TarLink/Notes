  - average user: around 4 secs to interact:
     - first page request: very fast
     - DOM loading: .5 secs
     - resource loading: 2 secs, pretty variable
     - RequireJS setup: .3 secs
     - 'startup' modules loading: .3 secs
     - main modules loading: .3 secs
     - startup controller: .3 secs, bigger when controller is bigger
     - initial AJAX requests: 2 secs:
        - request: 1+ sec
        - request handling: .5 secs
           - first agreement.set(): .3 secs
           - other agreement.set(): .3 secs
  - problematic users:
     - 22% >10sec, 6% >20sec, 2%>sec
     - mobile (because less computational power and network speed): around 15 secs
  - not a problem:
     - browser: does not change much
  - current solutions:
     - Public pages: less modules to load, no initial controller AJAX requests
  - actual problems:
     - bigger models (big agreement, many templates):
        - agreement.set()
        - PUT requests are waiting for response for a long time
     - devtools: make everything much slower
