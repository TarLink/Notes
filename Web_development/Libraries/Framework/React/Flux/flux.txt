VERSION ==>                       #2.1.1

DEVELOPMENT MODE ==>              #Like React

FLOW ==>                          #Specific case of MVC architecture.
                                  #Design:
                                  #  - steps:
                                  #     - one 'action', i.e. view event (i.e. anything changing state) notifying all models
                                  #     - if event relevant, models update
                                  #     - then whole view tree re-rendered with new models state
                                  #  - abstract APPSTATE/ACTION as a layer set by views, get by models:
                                  #     - views do not update models directly, they update APPSTATE
                                  #  - one-way data binding: always models -> views
                                  #Implementation:
                                  #  - Views notify singleton Dispatcher that app state changed
                                  #  - Dispatcher triggers all Stores __onDispatch() listener
                                  #     - Dispatcher's goal is to manage dependencies (see e.g. DISPATCHER.waitFor())
                                  #  - Stores __onDispatch() do model logic, optionally notifying they changed
                                  #     - are one or several models, associated to a common purpose/domain
                                  #  - Views associated with a Store that changed are re-rendered:
                                  #     - those View should be only few (e.g. only one root) because:
                                  #        - if two Views are associated with same Store and they have common children,
                                  #          children will be re-rendered twice, with potentially different props|state
                                  #        - with two-way data binding, this cannot be solved easily
                                  #     - are called "Controller-Views" (see React documentation about 'smart' components)
                                  #     - can pass all the Stores state to descendants as props, to simplify code,
                                  #       or reduce/transform/pick it ("selectors")
                                  #Steps (+ are done once, - at each dispatch)

                                  #     - should be an app singleton

                                  #     - notify new app state
