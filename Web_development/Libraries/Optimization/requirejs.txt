VERSION ==>                       #2.1.17

<script src="require.js"          #Loads require.js (synchronously), then MAINFILE (async.).

                                  #  - if rest of page (other <script>, including inline) need to use require(), should not
                                  #    use data-main nor async.
                                  #  - but at best, should not put any other <script>

require(PATH_ARR, FUNC([MDL...])) #Loads all MDL from PATH_ARR (managing dependencies order) then fires FUNC()

                                  #       returned "require" will have different CONFVAR.
