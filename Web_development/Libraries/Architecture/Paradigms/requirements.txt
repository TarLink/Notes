QUALITIES ==>                     #Should be INVEST:
																	#  - Independent: 
                                  #     - from other user stories
                                  #     - if some are tight together, put them as one user story
																	#  - Negotiable: 
                                  #     - can always be changed until start of coding
																	#  - Valuable: 
                                  #     - respond to stakeholders needs
																	#     - imply all stakeholders, i.e. people: using, misusing (enemies), regulating
																	#  - Estimable: 
                                  #     - put resources needed on it (time, price, material, etc.)
																	#  - Small: 
																	#     - not more than a few person-days
																	#     - when specifying, should cover the requirement, not less nor more
																	#  - Testable: 
																	#     - tested by one or several "acceptance tests"
																	#     - documented, traceable
																	#I.e.: valuable, granular (small, independent), easy to plan (can be estimated, tested, changed)

"WHAT TO DO", NOT "HOW TO DO" ==> #  - "what to do" (requirements) should be specified by stakeholders, not developers
																	#  - "how to do" (architecture, design) should be specified by developers, not stakeholders

HIGH-LEVEL FIRST ==>              #In order:
                                  #  - high-level need:
																	#     - guess actual need, i.e. why do you need to do this?
																	#     - first formulated "need" is usually not the real need but a possible answer to it (formulated by stakeholders)
																	#  - lower-level needs (summaries): to fulfill high-level need
																	#  - proposals

PROTOTYPE ==>                     #Proposal using fast implementation:
																	#  - focus is on stakeholder feedback
																	#  - can enter a review/enhance loop with stakeholder
																	#Completedness:
																	#  - structure only:
																	#     - partial ("sketch")
																	#     - complete ("wireframe"/"blueprint")
																	#  - visual design too ("mockup")
																	#     - low-fidelity
																	#        - should provide visual hints of incomplete visual design, e.g. black&white
																	#     - high-fidelity
																	#  - interaction too (with|without visual design):
																	#     - faked ("pretotype"), i.e. meant to be fast
																	#     - close to real one ("prototype")
																	#Scope:
																	#  - horizontal (the whole thing):
																	#     - broader validation
																	#  - vertical (a specific function): 
																	#     - more precise validation
																	#     - should specify which requirements are addressed
																	#Evolution:
																	#  - close-ended|throwaway|rapid: 
																	#     - not included in final product
																	#     - importance is speed of creation
																	#  - evolutionary|breadboard: 
																	#     - first step of final product
																	#     - importance is possibility to build on it.

SPECIFICATION ==>                 #Proposal in details and in prose, but from stakeholder perspective
																	#     - focus is on ease to implement: solution detailed enough to be used as a test of requirements
