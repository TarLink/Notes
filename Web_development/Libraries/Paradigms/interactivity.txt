INTERACTIVITY ==>                 #Amount|complexity of interface input
                                  #Tradeoff between simplicity and flexibility

TYPES ==>                         #Can be:
                                  #  - none, e.g. Unix command
                                  #  - menu-driven:
                                  #     - input is constrained to menus|submenus, describing the application state machine
                                  #     - e.g.:
                                  #        - CLI command asking for action among several choices
                                  #        - GUI app where actions can only be done through top bar
                                  #  - event-driven:
                                  #     - any input
                                  #        - including custom events, e.g. when a background task completed
                                  #        - at a low level, always correspond to some IRQ, e.g. device input, network, thread completion
                                  #     - can lead to complex state machine in event handlers:
                                  #        - event handlers should not check for current state
                                  #        - instead, state should modify|toggle event handlers
                                  #        - e.g.: SPA pages, REST routes
