PRINCIPLE ==>                     #Data flow:
                                  #  - one-way direction (parent to children) by design
                                  #      - communicating with parent: passing a FUNC as props
                                  #  - 'state' is state own by current RCOMP, 'props' is state owned by a parent
                                  #     - when changing it, current RCOMP and all children get 'updated' (if only props !=),
                                  #       'unmounted|mounted' (if CTYPE different according to DOM order / keys)
                                  #     - should have as many RCOMP without 'state' as possible, and concentrate them into few parents
                                  #     - reduce amount of 'state': 
                                  #        - not computed|duplicated from other 'state|props'
                                  #           - e.g. getInitialState() should not use props
                                  #        - not complex (e.g. not RELEM)
                                  #     - 'context':
                                  #        - like 'props' but with less typing
                                  #        - should only be used for 'props' that are used everywhere in the app, e.g. current
                                  #          user, design theme, etc.
                                  #        - should use explicit 'props' otherwise
                                  #  - children are owned by the RCOMP that create them:
                                  #     - i.e. in RCOMP.render() -> <RCOMP2>...</RCOMP2>, ... will be 'updated' when current RCOMP is, 
                                  #       but not when RCOMP2 is, except if cloned in RCOMP2.render()
                                  #        - will still be correctly 'mounted|unmounted'
                                  #Virtual DOM:
                                  #  - provides abstraction (e.g. can be used on server without real DOM)
                                  #  - allows faster diff algorithm
                                  #  - problem: makes it harder to reach to actual DOM
                                  #JSX: mixing templates into JavaScript because they belong together

GOOD PRACTICES ==>                #  - when passing props down, should explicitely pass props that are consumed, 
                                  #    e.g. deconstructing then spreading:
                                  #      var [ VAR, OBJ... ] = this.props;
                                  #      // Use VAR
                                  #      return <ELEM [VAR={VAR}] {...OBJ}>

BAD PRACTICES ==>                 #  - reaching to HTML elements instead of using RELEM/RCOMP abstraction:
                                  #     - e.g. using REF, REACTDOM.findDOMNode()
                                  #  - using RCOMP other than as 'this' in RCOMP methods:
                                  #     - e.g. using REACTDOM.render() return value
                                  #  - shortcircuiting data flow:
                                  #     - RCOMP.forceUpdate()

                                  #           - in lists of similar items, modifications might recreate all items
                                  #             (e.g. prepending, since it compares by DOM order)
                                  #           - this is bad for performance, but also does not retain state in those items

                                  #     - only add|remove attributes if only attributes changed
                                  #  - should not modify state nor read global state nor be async
