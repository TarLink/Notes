CSS:
  - for all specs:
     - check browser support (with updated browser versions):
        - supported:
           - completely documented: add to "supported"
           - not documented: add to "to document"
        - unsupported:
           - add to unsupported
              - write "(all)" if no supported features
           - add general description
     - document API unless no single supported feature
  - document "to document" features

HTML/DOM:
  - categorize by specification instead of by browser (like CSS)
  - use "standards list" to divide between recommendations, working drafts, editor drafts, "supported or not documented yet (recommendations)", "supported or not documented yet (working drafts)"
  - for all specs:
     - document API
     - remove ones already in supported
     - check browser support:
        - supported:
           - add to "to document"
        - unsupported:
           - add to unsupported
              - write "(all)" if no supported features
           - add general description
  - document "to document" features
