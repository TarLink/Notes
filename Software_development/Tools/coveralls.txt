COVERALLS ==>									#Nice coverage reports, with commit history.
															#When using Travis:
															#  - Automatic pull	requests commenting.
															#  - when defined, command line coveralls (and so Gulp plugins, etc.) use:
                              #     - ENVVAR TRAVID_JOB_ID: service_job_id 
                              #     - TRAVIS_COMMIT: git_commit
															#     - TRAVIS_BRANCH: git_branch
                              #     - "travis_ci": service_name
															#Also supports Jenkins, Circle CI, Codeship
															#Notifications: email, hipchat, campfile, webhook

coveralls											#Command line (Node module 2.11.1)
															#Upload to Coveralls. Read *.lcov from stdin.
															#Uses ENVVAR:
															#  - COVERALLS_SERVICE_NAME
															#  - COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN
															#  - COVERALLS_SERVICE_JOB_ID
															#  - COVERALLS_RUN_AT DATE_STR (automatically defined)
															#  - COVERALLS_GIT_COMMIT COMMIT_ID (e.g. HEAD) (automatically defined if in repo)
															#  - COVERALLS_GIT_BRANCH LBRANCH (automatically defined if in repo)
															#Can also use root file .coveralls.yml with service_name, repo_token, etc.

GULP-COVERALLS()							#Takes lcov files in input, do same thing as command line coveralls
                              #Version 0.1.2

KARMA-COVERALLS								#REPORTER that sends lcov (like command line coveralls). 
															#Should be after "coverage" REPORTER, putting lcov[only] in ./coverage/
                              #Version 0.1.4
															
REST API ==>									#POST - https://coveralls.io/api/v1/
															#Resources:
															#  - jobs:
															#     - repo_token: Coveralls secret user token. 
															#       Only required if no service_name and service_job_id
															#     - service_name: CI name (e.g. "travis[-pro]")
															#     - service_job_id: e.g. TRAVIS_JOB_ID
															#     - source_files OBJ_ARR:
															#        - name PATH
															#        - source STR
															#        - coverage LCONV
															#     - git:
															#        - head: id COMMIT_ID, author|committer_name|email, message
															#        - branch LBRANCH
															#        - remotes: name, url
