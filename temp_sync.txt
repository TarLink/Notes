<img|video|audio|object|iframe|svg>: 
  - does not block (because might take long)
  - can listen to load event

<style>, inline <style>: 
  - block parsing (because is directly parsed)
  - consider using external files instead if requires async (e.g. big)

Dynamically added <script src> or CSS <link>:
  - does not block parsing nor rendering

<script src>:
  - if async|defer: does not block parsing
  - otherwise: block parsing

CSS <link>:
  - Parsing:
     - blocked at next <script> (because <script> might use CSSOM)
  - Rendering:
     - in <head>: blocked (upfront dependency)
     - in <body>: block after (not before) (component dependency)
  - Exceptions:
     - Safari: block parsing and rendering under any condition, including dynamically adding
     - Firefox, in <body>: 
        - does not block rendering after nor before
        - can fix it by adding empty <script> just after <link> to block parsing (hence blocking rendering)

Performance problem:
  - should try parallel/async when possible, but sometimes serial/sync is needed:
     - CSS -> HTML: 
        - showing unstyled HTML is ugly and leads to FOUC (Flash of unstyled content), i.e. DOM jumping around
        - possible fixes:
           - block rendering by using <style> (if added dynamically) or <link> (in <body>, followed by empty <script>) before HTML
           - async load CSS, temporarily putting display: none on related HTML
              - possible async CSS load: 
                 - dynamically adding it
                 - <link rel="preload" url="URL.css" as="style" onload="this.rel = 'stylesheet';">
     - HTML -> JavaScript:
        - when script uses DOM
        - possible fixes: 
           - "defer" 
           - DOMContentLoaded
           - (older trick) <script> at end of <body>
     - CSS -> JavaScript:
        - when script uses CSSOM
        - fixes: CSS always blocks JavaScript. 
  - if no dependency should asynchronously load CSS or JavaScript
  - should group into components so that CSS/HTML only delay the HTML/JavaScript it depends on
     - above the fold / critical path CSS:
        - make first displayed DOM's CSS sync (e.g. using <link> in <head>), other CSS async
        - rougher approach to components-approach when not possible



Prefetching:
  - any <link>:
     - ATTR:
        - crossorigin: for CORS request (browser support???)
        - media MEDIAQUERYLIST
     - fire load|error event
  - Link: <URL>; rel=preload[; ATTR=VAL]... [S]
    <link rel="preload" href="URL">
     - does HTTP request async right away but does not parse/execute resource (only used for caching)
     - ATTR:
        - as TYPE: 
           - WINDOW.fetch() destination type, 
             i.e. script|style|image|font|media|object|embed|document|xslt|manifest|report|service|shared]worker
           - used for CSP and Accept [C]
        - nopush: if a HTTP2 server push has been received for that resource, do not use it
     - can use load event listener with "preload" to emulate (for any resource type):
        - <script> async: by adding to the DOM the resource
        - <script> defer: by also waiting for some order logic
     - browser support: only Chrome/Opera
  - Link: <URL>; rel=prefetch [S]
    <link rel="prefetch">
     - does HTTP request after document.onload but does not parse/execute resource (only used for caching)
     - should use "preload" if needed for current navigation action, "prefetch" for potential next action
     - browser support: not [mobile] Safari nor Opera mini
  - Link: <URL>; rel=dns-prefetch [S]
    <link rel="dns-prefetch">
     - same as prefetch, but for DNS request
     - browser support: not Opera mini
  - Link: <URL>; rel=prerender [S]
    <link rel="prerender">
     - does HTTP request after document.onload, and parse/execute resource:
        - in the background, i.e. not visible but will provide fast caching
        - only kept for short while, so should be next navigation
        - avoid abusing as it is resource intensive
     - browser support: only Chrome/Opera/IE
  - Link: <URL>; rel=preconnect[; ATTR=VAL]... [S]
    <link rel="preconnect">
     - does DNS+TLS+TCP request right away
     - browser support: only Chrome/Opera/Firefox
