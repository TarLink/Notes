                                  #  - its orientation is called "acyclic"
                                  #     - every graph can have an acyclic orientation

TOPOLOGICAL SORTING ==>           #Putting all the nodes of a directed acyclic graph in a list, where each "parent" node
                                  #comes before its "child", where "parent/child" is indicated by edge orientation.
                                  #If a directed graph:
                                  #  - has no cycle, then it has at least one topological sorting
                                  #  - has at least one topological sorting, then it has no cycle

LABELING ==>                      #Assigning values to edges ("edge value") or nodes

                                  #  - graph with same nodes, but invert edges (i.e. edges where there were none and vice-versa)
                                  #  - only for graphs with single edges

                                  #Is conceptually similar to a mathematical set.
                                  #Since it is a generalization of edges, most concepts of graphs/edges apply:
                                  #  - graph is called "hypergraph"
                                  #"Edge size":
                                  #  - number of nodes per edge

                                  #"clutter"/"sperner family":
                                  #  - when max node degree is 0|1
                                  #  - i.e. no edge is a subset of another edge

                                  #Also called "linear graph"

[FLOW] NETWORK ==>                #Directed graph where edges have a flow:
                                  #  - it is a number
                                  #  - it can vary with time
                                  #  - "capacity": maximum flow per edge
                                  #Flow represents entropy that:
                                  #  - originates from a "source" node
                                  #  - goes through edges
                                  #     - edges must preserve the amount of flow
                                  #  - ends in a "sink" node
                                  #Also called "transportation network"

DISTANCE MATRIX ==>               #Matrix representing a graph's nodes distances from each other
                                  #  - "distance" can be:
                                  #     - number of edges of shortest path
                                  #     - sum of edges weights of shortest path
                                  #  - columns represent end node, rows start node
                                  #     - for undirected graphs:
                                  #        - each node is both end and start
                                  #        - i.e. matrix is symmetric
