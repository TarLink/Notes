License:
  - figure out what are my goals
  - find best license combinations

Market research:
  - competitors:
     - features
        - including how capture is done
     - license
     - pricing
     - volume (e.g. number of users, website traffic)
     - marketing communication/strategy
     - clients (industries)
     - team size and roles

Ideas:
  - only show interaction on specific page or element or screen region
  - UX research tools features?
     - could be browser extension
     - but then shouldn't it use webrtc screen capture?
