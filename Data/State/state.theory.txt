IMPERATIVE VS FUNCTIONAL ==>      #Imperative programming emphasizes state manipulation
                                  #  - pros:
                                  #     - more flexible
                                  #     - more efficient
                                  #Functional programming emphasizes referential transparency
                                  #  - pros:
                                  #     - easier to reason with:
                                  #        - for programmers
                                  #        - for static analysis, e.g. easier to test
                                  #     - easier to optimize
                                  #  - usually corrolated with declarative programming

REFERENTIAL TRANSPARENCY ==>      #Also called "purity".
                                  #Function that can be replaced by its return value, i.e.:
                                  #  - does not cause side effects
                                  #  - does not depend on state outside its arguments (i.e. local scope)

IDEMPOTENCY ==>                   #Function that can be called twice without state change, i.e.:
                                  #  - side effect always result in same state (including no side effects)
                                  #  - does not depend on state outside its arguments (i.e. local scope)
                                  #Goal: duplicated calls (e.g. retries) are not a problem, i.e. no need to keep state about previous calls

SIDE EFFECT ==>                   #When state changes after a function has been fired, including:
                                  #  - changing caller state:
                                  #     - arguments passed by reference
                                  #     - global scope
                                  #  - changing closure state
                                  #  - changing control flow, e.g. jumping, including raising exception
                                  #Usually execution time is not considered side effect
                                  #Statement (causes side effects) vs expression (no side effects)
                                  #Alternative to causing side effect (when flexibility is needed, e.g. I/O): returning state|action object to caller

                                  #Goal: serializing while keeping information hiding, i.e. abstracting serialization away

                                  #        - not only the current "state" variable and head position
                                  #  - each state variation triggers different branch
                                  #     - trigger can take input ("Mealy machine") or not ("Moore machine")
                                  #  - each state change ("transition") jumps back to initial point
                                  #     - when on a given state, state can change to:

                                  #        - only 0-n possible states ("non-deterministic"/NFA)

                                  #     - i.e. modelling FUNC(...)->VAL (among ENUM) as a state machine
                                  #  - transducer (FST):
                                  #     - has a second state, which is output
                                  #Control flow can be implemented:
                                  #  - with structure, e.g. switch statement
                                  #  - with data, e.g. table lookup
                                  #  - with polymorphism:
                                  #     - a "context" holds a polymorphic "state object":
                                  #        - change state by changing state objects
