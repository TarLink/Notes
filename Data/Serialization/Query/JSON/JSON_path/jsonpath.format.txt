VERSION ==>                       #Only one, from a 2007 blog article

                                  #  - dchester jsonpath (prefered): fairly fast
                                  #  - s3u JSONPath: most features, but also way too slow until it is resolved
                                  #  - fastPath: not maintained
                                  #  - jQuery-JSONPath: not maintained, requires jQuery
                                  #  - f5io: not very close to spec


FILTER...

$: root. Must be first.

['VAR']: OBJ.VAR
['NUM']: ARR[NUM]
[*]: OBJ.* or ARR[*]
..FILTER: OBJ|ARR.**.FILTER --- only for OBJ???
.FILTER: same as [FILTER]
[FILTER,...]: or
[[NUM]:[NUM2][:STEP]]: ARR from NUM to NUM2. NUM[2] can be negative for "from end"
[(@FILTER...)]: like ['VAR|NUM'] with 'VAR|NUM' === current OBJ|ARR with FILTER... applied
[?(@FILTER)]: like [*] but only keep the elements that evaluates to true with FILTER... applied
